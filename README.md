<h1>Hi, I'm Jonathon Scofield <br/><a href="https://github.com/jdscofield">Programmer</a>, <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/jdsco45">Lab Administrator</a>
<p>I currently work in a datacenter as a lab administrator for a larger company. I also have a wife and an almost 1 year old daughter who are everything to me. My career goals are to transition more into the software development area of the tech industry, as currently I tend to work mostly with hardware. I am finishing up my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Analytics at SNHU, and had previously gotten my Associates in Computer Programming from a local community college.</p>

<h2>Languages that I have experience in:</h2>
<lo>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>Visual Basic</li>
</lo>
<p> I also have some experience with databases, both SQL and NOSQL</p>

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Software Development Projects:</h2>

- <b>Capstone Project CS499</b>
  - <a href=https://github.com/jdscofield/CS-499-Travel-Application-Final>Final Capstone Project</a>
  -<p>For my project I took an application that allowed users to scroll through multiple different exotic destinations and read information about them, and decided to turn this into a full application that could satisfy all of the requirements of the project. For application design I chose C# with WPF for the gui. I had never used WPF before and so it was a learning experience not only for designing the gui itself but also for figuring out how the application's elements connected to the graphical interfaces. For the database I chose SQLite in order to store the user and trip information, and to show different algorithms I created a sorting algorithm to sort the favorited destinations by either their rating or by their name.</p>
