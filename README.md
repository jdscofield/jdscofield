<h1>Hi, I'm Jonathon Scofield <br/><a href="https://github.com/jdscofield">Programmer</a>, <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/jdsco45">Lab Administrator</a></h1>
<br/>
<p>I currently work in a datacenter as a lab administrator for a larger company. I also have a wife and an almost 1 year old daughter who are everything to me. My career goals are to transition more into the software development area of the tech industry, as currently I tend to work mostly with hardware. I am finishing up my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Analytics at SNHU, and had previously gotten my Associates in Computer Programming from a local community college.</p>

<h2>Languages that I have experience in:</h2>
<lo>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>Visual Basic</li>
</lo>
<p> I also have some experience with databases, both SQL and NOSQL</p>

<h3>Capstone Project CS499</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/jdscofield/CS-499-Travel-Application-Final">Final Capstone Project</a>
<p>For my project I took an application that allowed users to scroll through multiple different exotic destinations and read information about them, and decided to turn this into a full application that could satisfy all of the requirements of the project.</p>

<h2>Informal Code Review:</h2>

<p>For application design I chose C# with WPF for the gui. I had never used WPF before and so it was a learning experience not only for designing the gui itself but also for figuring out how the application's elements connected to the graphical interfaces. For the database I chose SQLite in order to store the user and trip information, and to show different algorithms I created a sorting algorithm to sort the favorited destinations by either their rating or by their name.</p>

<h2>Application Design</h2>
<p>When I started working on the application I first drew up a design of how I wanted the application to function generally:</p>

<p>For the application's design I broke it down into three major pages, all rendering on top of a window. The login page is the first page to come up and includes a textbox and passwordbox for the user login. In order to give the user the option of seeing the password's letters or not I added a checkbox that actually flips between using a passwordbox for password input and using a textbox for password input.</p>

<br/>
<p>The user can then go to a register screen that will allow them to create a new user. The register screen takes in the desired username as well as the desired password, and then hashes the password. The username and hashed password are then stored in the application's database so that they can be accessed later.</p>

<br/>
<p>Once logged in, the user accesses a page that holds the full list of destinations. The destinations are shown one at a time, with an image related to the destination as well as the title and description of the destination. The rating of the destination is also shown so that the user has an idea of how good the destinations are in comparison to each other.</p>

<br/>

<p>If the user clicks the button with the "+" sign on it in the top right of the page then the currently viewed destination is added to that user's favorites list. The acknoledgement of this is done by turning the background of the destination information green.</p>

<br/>

<p>The user can then go to the favorites page, where the destinations that they favorited are listed in a listbox on the side of the screen. Selecting the favorite destination will bring up the destination information. The destinations can also be sorted here by either name or rating by using the buttons above the listbox.</p>

<h2>Sorting Algorithm</h2>
<p>The sorting algorithm that I used was a quicksort. This was used because it can scale up to large datasets easily and is very fast and efficient at sorting elements. The quicksort divides that list of elements and sorts the divided</p>
